        Flutter transforms the app development process. Build, test,
         and deploy beautiful mobile, web, desktop, and embedded apps from a single 
         codebase. </article>
    <h3><b>Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, 
        natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.</b></h3>
    <p>Fast
        Flutter code compiles to ARM or Intel machine code as well as JavaScript,
        for fast performance on any device.        Multi-Platform
        Reach users on every screen
        Deploy to multiple devices from a single codebase: mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices.
        Developer Experience
Transform your workflow
Take control of your codebase with automated testing, developer tooling, and everything else you need 
to build production-quality apps.

    <h3><b>list of widgets</b></h3>
    <p>Create beautiful apps faster with Flutter’s collection of visual, structural, 
        platform, and interactive widgets. In addition
         to browsing widgets by category, you can also see all the widgets in the widget index.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>Animation and Motion</li>
        <li>Assets, Images, and Icons</li>
        <li>Async</li>

    </ol>
   
    <h3><b>widget</b></h3>
    <p>MergeSemantics class Null safety
        A widget that merges the semantics of its descendants.
        
        Causes all the semantics of the subtree rooted at this node to be merged into one 
        node in the semantics tree. For example, if you have a widget with a Text node next to 
        a checkbox widget, this could be used to merge the label from the Text node with the 
        <mark>"checked"</mark> semantic state of the checkbox into a single node that had both the label and the 
        checked state. Otherwise, the label would be presented as a separate feature than the checkbox,
         and the user would not be able to be sure that they were related.

    </p>
    <h3><b>About scroll view</b></h3>
    <p>CustomScrollView class Null safety
        A ScrollView that creates custom scroll effects using slivers.
        
        A CustomScrollView lets you supply slivers directly to create various scrolling effects, 
        such as lists, grids, and expanding headers. For example, to create a scroll view that contains 
        an expanding app bar followed by a list and a grid, use a list of three slivers: SliverAppBar, 
        SliverList, and SliverGrid.
        
        Widgets in these slivers must produce RenderSliver objects.
        
        To control the initial scroll offset of the scroll view, provide a controller with its 
        ScrollController.initialScrollOffset property set.</p>

        <li>CustomScrollView</li>
        <li>DraggableScrollableSheet</li>
        <li>GridView</li>
        <li>ListView</li>
        <li>NestedScrollView</li>
        <li>NotificationListener</li>

    <h3><b>Is Flutter is worth to learn?</b></h3>
    <p>progress → double
        Determines the percentage of spinner ticks that will be shown. Typical usage would display 
        all ticks, however, this allows for more fine-grained control such as during pull-to-refresh 
        when the drag-down action shows one tick at a time as the user continues to drag down. [...]
        final
        radius → double
        Radius of the spinner widget. [...]
        final
        runtimeType → Type
        A representation of the runtime type of the object.

         <strong><i>Flutter's slogan, “everything is a widget,” revolves around building user 
            interfaces by composing widgets that are, in turn, composed of progressively more 
            basic widgets.</i></strong>
